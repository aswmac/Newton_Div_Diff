A synthetic divide gives two things, not just the eval of the polynomial,
but the quotient $f(x) = (x-a)g(x) + f(a)$ then if want $f(b)$ it is $(b-a)g(b) + f(a)$

Well, $g(b)$ is evaluated (in one fewer steps than f) and that is multiplied and added
with $f(a)$ term--well that sounds like another synth-step!
